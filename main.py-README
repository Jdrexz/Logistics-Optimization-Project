# Logistics Optimization
A small linear programming example that assigns shipments to carriers to minimize total cost subject to carrier capacity constraints.

**How to run**
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python main.py`

**Customize**
- Replace the sample cost matrix with real cost data (CSV).
- Add constraints for weight, volume, or routing distance.
- Integrate with your TMS or routing API to pull actual carrier costs.
